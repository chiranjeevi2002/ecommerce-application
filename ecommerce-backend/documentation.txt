# 🌐 **Multi-Tenant Ecommerce Platform – Project Documentation**

## 📌 **1. Overview**

This project is a **multi-tenant ecommerce platform** designed to support multiple businesses inside a single scalable system. Each tenant (store) has **fully isolated data, independent configurations, and separate product catalogs**, while all microservices run on a shared infrastructure.

The platform supports different store domains such as:

* **Flower Store**
* **Medical Store**
* **Grocery Store**
* **Electronics Store**

Users select the store at login, and Admins can switch stores anytime. The system ensures strict tenant isolation, high scalability, and flexible onboarding of new stores.

---

## 🚀 **2. Key Features**

### **🔹 Multi-Tenant Architecture**

* Each store works like an independent ecommerce system.
* Isolated data: products, orders, customers, inventory.
* SUPERADMIN controls global settings and store creation.
* Tenants identified using **storeId** passed through the API Gateway.

### **🔹 Role-Based Access Control**

Roles include:

* **SUPERADMIN** → manages all stores, create admins.
* **ADMIN** → store management (products, categories, inventory).
* **CUSTOMER** → browse & purchase items.

Role restrictions:

* Customers see only selected store’s products.
* Admins can switch stores for management actions.

### **🔹 Scalable Microservice Architecture**

Services included:

1. **API Gateway** – Routing, JWT authentication, storeId propagation
2. **Eureka Service Discovery** – Registers & locates microservices
3. **UserService** – Spring Web
4. **ProductService** – Spring Web
5. **InventoryService** – Spring Web
6. **PaymentService** – Spring Web
7. **OrderService** – Spring WebFlux (high concurrency, non-blocking)

### **🔹 Centralized Authentication**

* Login once → Gateway issues JWT with `storeId` + role.
* Every service receives tenant mode through headers.
* Tenant switching is seamless and secure.

### **🔹 Complete Ecommerce Modules**

* Product Catalog
* Categories
* Inventory Sync
* Cart + Checkout
* Order lifecycle: CREATED → PAID → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
* Payment workflow (stubbed)
* Analytics for Admins

### **🔹 Observability & Monitoring**

* **Micrometer** for metrics
* **Zipkin** for tracing (already configured, works when running multiple nodes)

### **🔹 Frontend**

* Built using **React JSX** with Bootstrap styling.
* Store selection, product browsing, payments, orders, and admin dashboard.

## 🏗️ **3. System Architecture**

### **Microservices Structure**

| Service              | Technology           | Description                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**      | Spring Cloud Gateway | Central routing, JWT, storeId filtering |
| **Eureka Server**    | Spring Cloud Netflix | Service registry/discovery              |
| **UserService**      | Spring Web           | Users, roles, authentication            |
| **ProductService**   | Spring Web           | Products, categories                    |
| **InventoryService** | Spring Web           | Stock management                        |
| **OrderService**     | Spring WebFlux       | High-performance order placement        |
| **PaymentService**   | Spring Web           | Payment handling                        |
| **Frontend**         | React JSX, Bootstrap | Client UI for customer + admin          |

### **Service-to-Service Communication**

All inter-service calls use:

* **Spring WebClient**
* Load-balanced with Eureka discovery
* Non-blocking where required (OrderService)

---

## 🗂️ **4. Data Isolation Strategy**

### **Tenant Identification**

* Each request carries **storeId** from JWT → Gateway → Services.
* Every service applies `WHERE store_id = ?` rules.
* Product lists, inventory counts, orders, and users are per-tenant.

### **Database Layer**

* Shared schema with tenant column
  OR
* Table-per-tenant (configurable)

Current implementation uses **tenant column strategy**.

---
